# Over Browser Clusters

Below is a list of open clusters and their timeouts. The default username is `pi` and the password is `raspberry`. Each of the Masters was setup to run openly with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and stream shell with [shellinabox](https://github.com/fufu70/raspberry-pi-cluster-install/blob/master/SHELL_OVER_HTTP.md).
